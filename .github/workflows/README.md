Github Actions workflow YAML scripts which demonstrate:

1. Matrix-builds for each OS by programming language version. For example, 2 OS choices and 3 language versions will run 6 total builds.
1. Various lint programs for each language.
1. Languages are organized by directory, which prunes matrix-builds to save cost and time.
